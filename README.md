## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](tp1)

Main implementation points:
- Successful implementation of all proposed features
- Verification and removal of "back edges" which introduce cycles in the given graph
- Single validation of graph components, meaning no further conditional statements need to be executed when displaying each node, i.e., unused components defined in the XML file are removed from the graph before starting the display process
- Implementation of the light's attenuation

Scene:
- Can be described as a recreation of the Solar System. Contains all of it's planets, the sun, a realistic sattelite, and a spaceship.  
- [Scene link](./tp1/scenes/space.xml)
